     <h2 class=big>Music is a Journey</h2>
    <img src="listen.jpeg" alt="Man with Headphones">

    <p><strong>Music is everywhere!</strong></p>
    <p> With modern technology, people can have a 24/7 soundtrack
      playing in their ears just the way they want it. Music is an industry that only 
      keeps evolving and is never out of style. From country music to heavy metal, there
      is always something to listen to.
    </p>
    <p><em>But what are we tuned into?</em></p>
    <p>Even though the beat might be "killer" the message behind the song might not
      be so great. For every art form there is a <em>purpose</em> or <em>intent</em> 
    behind it. Even music without lyrics seem to have a spirit in them. A piece by Beetoven can
  move you without telling you "this is sad" or "this is happy." Why else would we listen to
  it if it didn't? What is passing through our ears and into our minds has meaning 
  behind it. So then, what is that meaning?   </p>

    <h2 class=big>What's in the Lyrics?</h2>
    <img src='singing.jpg' width="550" height="400" alt="A Person Singing">
      <p>From the Bible, Romans 10:17 says:</p>
      <h4>"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</h4>
      <p><em>But what does that have to do with music?</em></p>
      <p><strong>A lot!</strong> Here's the thing. Those words we are putting in our ears feeds into
        how we view or think about different subjects in our one lives. Let's take school for example: 
        we <em>listen</em> to what our instructor is telling us about math, history, or other subjects
        to teach us something new--change or improve how we think about these courses. 
        <p>"So you're saying that if I listen to music about being a gang member I will become one?"</p>
        <p>No. What I am saying is that if you are constantly listening to music that promotes
          the idea that your worth comes from making a lot of money or that dressing/acting a certain
          way will get into a good relationship, it will start <strong>affecting</strong> how you
          view the world, those around you, and yourself.

    <h2 class=big>Don't Stop Dancing</h2>
    <img src='dance2.jpg'alt="People Dancing" width='500' height="400">
      <h4>So what about that song with the killer beat but not a so good message?</h4>
      <p>The bad news is you probably should let that one go. You will be better off not listening
        to it anyway.The <strong>good</strong> news is that great instrumentals and awesome lyrics 
        do not have to be a trade off. There are many musicians who put both aspects in their songs.
        At the same time, making this change doesn't necessarily mean you can never listen to anything by
        K$sha again. Not every song by one artist is bad but not every song by your favorite artist 
        will be good for you either. Remember, music is expression which means it comes out of different viewpoints
        and experiences. At the same time, with all the ways you can find music nowdays, there 
        are so many great artists and songs just waiting for you to discover them. 
        Don't put your dancing shoes away just yet!

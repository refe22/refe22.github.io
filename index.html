      <h3>Music is a Journey</h3>
      <img src="listen.jpeg">
      <p><strong>Music is everywhere!</strong></p>
      <p> With modern technology, people can have a 24/7 soundtrack
        playing in their ears just the way they want it. Music is an industry that only 
        keeps evolving and is never out of style. From country music to heavy metal, there
        is always someone tuned in.
      </p>
      <p><em>But what are we tuned into?</em></p>
      <p>Even though the beat might be "killer" the message behind the song might not
        be so great. For every art form there is a <em>purpose</em> or <em>intent</em> 
      behind it. Even music without lyrics seem to have a spirit in them
    that moves you without telling you "this is sad" or "this is happy." What is passing 
  through our ears and into our minds has emotion and meaning behind it. So, what is 
that meaning?   </p>

    <h3>What's in the Lyrics?</h3>
    <img src='singing.jpg'>
      <p>From the Bible, Romans 10:17 says:</p>
      <h4>"So then faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."</h4>
      <p><em>But what does that have to do with music?</em></p>
      <p><strong>A lot!</strong> Here's the thing. That stuff we are putting in our ears, it feeds into
        how we view things or think about things. We go to school to learn by watching
        but also <em>listening</em> to what our instructor is telling us. 
        <p>"Are you saying if I listen to music about being a gang member I will become one?</p>
        <p>No. What I am saying is that if you constantly listen to music that promotes
          the idea that worth comes from making a lot of money or dressing/acting a certain
          way will get into a relationship, it will start <strong>affecting</strong> how you
          view those subjects and change the way you think about them. So then, what should 
          I do?

    <h3>Dancing Time!</h3>
    <img src='dance.jpeg'>
      <h4>So now what do you do we do about that killer beat but not so good message?</h4>
      <p>The bad news is you probably would be better off not listening to that strong.
        The <strong>good</strong> news is that a great instrumental and awesome lyrics 
        do not have to be a trade off. Don't put your dancing shoes away just yet!

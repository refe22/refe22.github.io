    <h3>Topic 1: Christian Music</h3>
    <p> What does it mean for a song to be apart of the Christian genre?
    </p>
    <p>When people think of Christian music, the first think people think of
        is a church choir and some organ playing. Not to say that type of music
        is bad or boring, but that's not what Christian music is.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Christianity is the theme, not the genre</strong></p>
    <p>Like we said before, every song has meaning in some form or the other
        and for a Christian, a song that shares the message of Jesus Christ and
        supports Biblical ways of life (ex: respecting people even when they don't 
        respect you) make a song Christian or something that has Christian values. We pick
        our songs for our Top Ten page based on this. 
        This is all to say that not every song that is in the Christian genre is neccessarily
         "Christian" and vice versa: there are some "secular" songs that support Christian principles
        in their meaning without having the title. If you are interested in Christian music,
        take the time to look up some different genres and find some great music that 
        has a good message. our <strong>Top Ten </strong> tab features many artists with
        have accomplished this. Be sure to check it out!
